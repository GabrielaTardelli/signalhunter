Signal Hunter is na open-source and free software developed using  
MATLAB 2014 (Mathworks, Natick, USA) for electrophysiological signal  
analysis. Research groups lack software that allows assisted processing and  
automatic tools to analyze electroencephalography (EEG) and  
electromyography (EMG) recordings. Therefore, Signal Hunter was created to  
provide a general graphical environment with basic tools that allow users  
to easily develop their functions and interfaces.

Main features consist of:

- signals visualization;  
- amplitude and latency automatic calculation;  
- graphical interface to manual edit calculated descriptors;  
- save and load processing progress;  
- export data to table...  

Future development may cover processing in frequency domain and spatial  
processing of array EMG recordings. Signal Hunter is constructed under a  
module-based strategy, where new functions can be easily added by the user.
